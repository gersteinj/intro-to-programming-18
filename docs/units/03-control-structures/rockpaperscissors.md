| Feature Requirements Weighted x3 | Goes significantly beyond minimum requirements                                                                                                                        | Slightly exceeds minimum requirements         | Meets minimum requirements                                                                                 | Meets a few requirements                           | Meets few to no requirements                                                                  |
| Comments                         | Comments, naming standards, and overall code structure are clear, easy to understand, and display a strong understanding of the code.                                 | Code is generally clear                       | Comments and naming standards are acceptable, but there are sections that are unclear or poorly documented | Comments are minimal                               | Comments? What comments?                                                                      |
| Code Quality Weighted x3         | Code is cleanly written and very effective. Code in this category will show that the coder has made an effort to address problems that could arise when running code. | Code is correct and generally free of errors  | Some errors affect the functioning of the program                                                          | Major errors affect the functioning of the program | Code works extremely poorly                                                                   |
| User Interface/User Experience   | Program makes clear to the user what is happening and it is enjoyable to play.                                                                                        | Game is fairly easy to understand how to play | Playing game is somewhat confusing                                                                         | Playing game is very confusing                     | Can't play game                                                                               |
| Use of Functions                 | Makes excellent use of functions                                                                                                                                      |                                               | Functions are used correctly but not implemented particularly well                                         |                                                    | Functions are not used or are used so poorly they indicate a serious lack of understanding    |
| Use of Dictionaries              | Makes excellent use of at least one dictionary                                                                                                                        |                                               | At least one dictionary is present, but may not be used effectively                                        |                                                    | Dictionaries are not used or are used so poorly they indicate a serious lack of understanding |
