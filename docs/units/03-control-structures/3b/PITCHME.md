## Core Concepts

* Conditional statements
* Loops
---
## While Loops

* *while* something is True *do* something
* ideal for when you don't necessarily have a set of items or a set number of repetitions

```python
n = 0

while n <= 100:
    print(n)
    n += 1
```
---
## For loops

* *do* something *for each item* in a range

```python
for x in range(101):
    print(x)
```

```python
people = ["Jen", "Jean", "Jim", "Bill", "Rick", "Audrey", "Kung"]

for person in people:
    print(f"Good morning {person}")
```
