## Rubric

| Category | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Requirements Weighted x3 | Has features beyond requirements given | Meets all given requirements | Meets most requirements | Meets a few requirements | Meets few to no requirements |
| Comments | Comments display a clear understanding of the code | Comments are mostly good but could be more informative | Some comments are present, but large sections of code are uncommented | Comments are minimal | Comments? What comments? |
| Code Quality Weighted x3 | Code is cleanly written and very effective. Code in this category will show that the coder has made an effort to address problems that could arise when running code. | Code is correct and generally free of errors | Some errors affect the functioning of the program | Major errors affect the functioning of the program | Code works extremely poorly |
| User Interface/User Experience | Program makes clear to the user what is happening and it is enjoyable to play. For instance, program has an effective way of tracking failed guesses. | Game is fairly easy to understand how to play | Playing game is somewhat confusing | Playing game is very confusing | Can't play game |

## Suggestions

* Break it into small sections and write your code a little at a time
* Test early, test often
* While testing, you can use print() to show what a value is
---
# Helpful Code
---
## in

* The `in` operator checks to see if some object exists in a sequence
* Typically used with lists or strings
* `'n' in 'Magnet'` is a True statement
---
## Looping Through Strings

* Can use a for loop for each character in a string

```python
for letter in "New Jersey":
    print(letter)
```
