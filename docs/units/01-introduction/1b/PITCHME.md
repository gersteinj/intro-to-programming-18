## Do Now

Look at sample code. What can you figure out about it?
---
## Core Concepts

* What is a programming language?
* Why Python?
* How do we use Python?
* Python resources
---
## Programming Languages

* Formal, structured way to give directions to computers
* General concepts apply across most languages
* Usually (but not always) text-based
* Each language has formatting rules
* Syntax is the grammar of a programming language
---
## Why Python?

* Commonly used as a tool
* Used as an introductory language in many college CS programs
* Heavily used in science and engineering
---
## Working in Python

* You write Python code
* Computer executes your code one line at a time
* Script mode vs Interactive mode
---
### Interactive Mode

* Run one line at a time
* Useful for trying things out
* Use command line in terminal
---
### Script Mode

* Write a text file ending in .py
* Computer will execute each line without your involvement (unless your code involves user input)
