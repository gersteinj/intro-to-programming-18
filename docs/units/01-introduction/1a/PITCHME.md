# Intro to Programming

#### Unit 1 Section A - What is Programming?
---
## Do Now

Come up with a task that can be done within the classroom. Write down directions for how to do it
---
## Core Concepts

* The nature of programming
* Working with pseudocode
* Flowcharts
---
## Programming

* A series of detailed directions
* What are some non-computer based things that could be seen as programming?
---
## Computerless Programming

Find your partner. I'll give each person 2 minutes to direct their partner on how to accomplish their task, then we'll switch.
---
## Pseudocode

* Simplified way of describing an algorithm
* Write out each step of the program & indent lines that are dependent on the line before
---
<pre>
wake up
check day
if day is equal to Saturday or Sunday
    go back to sleep
else
    check time
    if time is later than 7 AM
        get out of bed
        brush teeth
        get dressed
        go to school
    else go back to sleep
</pre>
---
<pre>
initialize students as list of student names
for each student name in students
    print "hello <student name>"
</pre>
---
<pre>
if student's grade is greater than or equal to 65
    print "pass"
else
    print "fail"
</pre>
---
## Flowcharts

* Diagram showing an algorithm or process
* Different shapes have different meanings
* Three main shapes: terminator, process, decision

<h2>Process</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Rectangle</li>
    <li>A single step</li>
    <li>Any number of inputs</li>
    <li>One output</li>
    <li>No decisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Decision</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Diamond</li>
    <li>Yes/no question</li>
    <li>Any number of inputs</li>
    <li>Two outputs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Terminator</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Rectangle with rounded ends</li>
    <li>Start or end a chart</li>
    <li>One output for start</li>
    <li>Any number of inputs for end</li>
</ul>

## Flowcharts

Try it together: How could we write a flowchart for when you arrive to school?
---
# SGO Pre-assessment
---
## Directions

* Choose a process
* Create pseudocode and a flowchart for that process
* You may use digital tools (if your AUP is signed) or paper
---
## Evaluation

* Exercise (graded as complete, partially complete, or inadequate)
* Will get feedback as if it were classwork
---
## Submitting Work

* Google Classroom (submit correctly!) if digital
* Put in folder for your class if paper
---
## Remember to get your AUP signed
