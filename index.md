# Introduction to Programming - Fall 2018
## UCMHS  | Ms. Gerstein | Junior Technology

## About the Course

Computers are used by scientists, engineers, designers, and artists to work with data. Whether that data takes the form of text, images, video, or sound, the core concepts and logic remain the same. This course will present fundamental concepts and best practices of computer programming through the creation of data visualizations, useful tools, and games. We will be using Python, an open source language, in a hands-on environment. In developing your programs, you will learn to use version control, think like a programmer, and work collaboratively.

## Course Goals and Objectives

Students will be able to:
* Apply coding techniques to solve problems
* Work within an IDE to write, test, and debug code
* Develop clear and useful flowcharts to describe processes
* Develop pseudocode from flowcharts as an intermediate step to writing software
* Understand syntax, dta types, variables, mathematical operations, and user input
* Understand how and why to include comments in software
* Work with Boolean logic
* Manipulate and visualize data
* Learn how to use object oriented programming techniques
* Use version control systems individually and as a collaborative tool
* Understand the binary number system and how it is used in computers

## Course Materials

All work for this course can be performed on the school-issued Chromebooks. If students wish to install the software to work on other computers, setup guides can be provided. All work can be completed with free software. We will be using Python, Cloud9, Git, and Google Docs.

## Classroom Procedures and Expectations

* Follow all MHS rules and policies
* Respect your classmates' opinions and contributions
* Take responsibility for your actions in and out of class
* Obtain all missed notes and assignments if you have been absent - I will help, but it is *your* responsibility to seek out the information you missed
* Turn in all required work on time and in a professional manner
* Participate appropriately in class: contribute to discussions and activities and behave professionally
* If you need to use the restroom or get water, please use the sign in/out sheet and take the bathroom pass. If the pass is not available, please wait until it is returned. If it's an emergency, let me know. If you need to leave the room for other reasons, please ask permission and remember to sign out/in.
* If you enter the room late, please enter quietly and give me your late pass before sitting down
* You will be expected to behave professionally and will be treated accordingly. Seating will not be assigned unless necessary. You may talk quietly or listen to music while doing independent work, as long as it doesn't keep you from doing your work. This does not apply when you are not doing independent work.
* If you need assistance or have conflicts with other assignments, it is your responsibility to seek help in a timely manner. Do not wait until the day before a major project is due to ask for help.
* Please bring your Chromebook to class each day. You will need a computer to do your coursework, and not having it will affect your participation grade.

## Grading Policy

Grading will be based on a mix of participation, classwork, quizzes, and projects. Grading is done using total points. Rubrics will be provided for all major assignments.

## Assignment submission
All assignments are to be submitted in the required format no later than the required date and time. Late submissions will be subject to a penalty of 10% of the toal grade for each day they are late. In order to communicate effectively, proper spelling and grammar are required.
